# Homework 1

# Purpose
Accessiblity standards must be met to allow a website to be accessible to people with disabilities and those requiring assistive technologies, ensuring good business practices and helping businesses avoid unnecessary litigation. Increased accessibility also optimizes a page's ranking in search engines such as Google. We achieve this by ensuring functional links, such as making the Search Engine Optimization tab direct to the appropriate section below on the webpage, replacing div tags with semantic HTML elements, rearranging and consolidating CSS style properties, using alt attributes on images, and providing a concise and descriptive title to the website.

# Usage
1. Open the Horiseon URL in your browser.
2. Navigate the website by scrolling up and down and using the top navigation bar to shortcut to specific sections.
